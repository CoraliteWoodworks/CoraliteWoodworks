                <li>"I have hired Coralite many times for projects ranging from kitchen cabinetry to new windows. Just
                    recently he created a new front door using the existing barn doors that were there. Brian is a true
                    craftsman with exquisite attention to detail. I
                    have been so thoroughly satisfied with his work that I continue to hire him whenever I need
                    something done. He is a perfectionist and understands what I'm looking for -- often with ideas that
                    enhance the job in ways I never thought of. Professional,
                    creative, talented and also a very nice person. It doesn't get much better than that when you hire
                    someone to come into your home. He is my first recommendation to anyone. He is excellent."<a

                <li>"Coralite Woodworks has done several projects at our house including remodeling a bathroom (with
                    tilling), built a composite deck, repaired significant amount of rotted wood from the exterior and
                    interior, replaced two windows and a sliding glass
                    door and built two beautiful built-in bookshelves to perfectly compliment a desk we already owned.
                    They have always been professional, responsive, competitively priced and workmanship has been
                    consistent and of a very high quality. We would gladly
                    recommend them."<a href="http://www.houzz.com/viewReview/150228/Coralite-Woodworks-LLC--review"

                <li>"Impressed by the excellent work of a rebuilt bathroom completed in 2012, Coralite was again hired
                    to install a new kitchen in my house starting from bare walls. The work was completed on time and to
                    the original budget estimate in spite of design
                    changes ordered during work in progress. Coralite is a dependable company where all work is either
                    pertormed or closely overseen by the owner - Brian Matte. Brian is a very talented craftsman.
                    Anything perhaps beyond his expertise - ex. plumbing,
                    electrical, granite installations - are sub-contracted to equally talented specialists. I was
                    completely satisfied 100%with the completed projects and thank Brian for his undivided attention
                    until completion of the two projects."<a

                <li>"We have employed Brian Matte' and Coralite Woodworks for a number of home improvement projects over
                    the past 10 years and our experience has been uniformly excellent. For the most recent project, we
                    had our laundry room redone and we replaced the
                    washer and dryer. We contracted with Brian to remove the old washer and dryer from the room, to
                    replace an old metal cabinet over the machines with a new custom-fitted one, to replace the existing
                    (leaking) water hookup assembly for the washer,
                    to replace/upgrade the dryer venting to the outside of the house, to replace the smoke detector, to
                    remove the wallpaper, to patch the walls, to prime and paint the walls, doors and wood work, to
                    replace the door hinges and knobs, to install a new
                    threshold and weather stripping for the door from the laundry room into the garage, and to assist
                    with installation of the new washer and dryer as needed after delivery of the machines from Home
                    Depot. We were operating on a tight schedule and Brian
                    was able to complete all the work on tine and on budget and to satisfy our requests for a few last
                    minute changes. He was very professional throughout and a pleasure to deal with."<a

                <li>"Working with Coralite has always been a great experience. Brian and his team are professional,
                    highly dependable, creative and very friendly. We have worked with Brian for over 20 years, both in
                    our current and previous home. The most recent project
                    was the largest. He finished two rooms in our basement. We are very pleased with the results. It
                    finished smoothly, on time and on budget. I would not hesitate to recommend Coralite and will always
                    call Brian if and when we have other projects."

                    to and accommodated all of our design ideas and offered suggestions for making it even better. Brian
                    is easy to work with and excellent at his craft.

                    installing crown moulding and baseboard trim. The craftsmanship and quality is absolutely
                    outstanding. Super attention to detail. We could not be happier

                <li>"Brian Matté of Coralite Woodworks he done many jobs for me including replacing windows, kitchen
                    cabinets and some flooring in my 80 year old summer residence. His work is always completed as
                    planned, on time and within budget. Most recently he replaced
                    the sheetrock ceilings in three rooms which had been damaged by moisture. This is a description of
                    the job which is referred to below. Remove and replace existing sheetrock ceilings in rear and front
                    bedroom and 6 x 8 area of ceiling in kitchen..
                    Install crown moulding trim around ceilings in two bedrooms. Paint all ceilings and trim - two
                    coats. I would highly recommend his company."

                <li>"Brian was very professional and organized in our first interaction. He gave a clear estimate and
                    drawings of our project, with great suggestions. We hired to build large 20' + built in wall cabinet
                    with doors and shelves. Great at matching our taste
                    and other furniture in family room. Did most work at his workshop so was not messy in our home. He
                    invited us to visit the project along the way. The quality was exceptional!! The cost was higher
                    then what we hoped for or anticipated, but the quality
                    and workmanship of the details, wood and stain, lighting, doors, knobs etc was all perfect so we had
                    no regreat. Expect to pay perhaps higher then others, but you will get a great outcome and trust the
                    craftsmanship upon completion. Brian truly
                    loves what he does and it shows in th work!!"<a

                <li>"Brian is a refreshing contractor - professional, artistic and organized. We wanted to create a
                    library that was both traditional, but offered modern amenities. Brian designed custom panels, built
                    ins, using columns and corbels we had found, as well
                    as developing an electrical plan that allowed us to install upgrades for an audio and video system.
                    Our library is stunning and the workmanship could not have been better."<a
